# Merkle-Hash-Tree

This simulates a Merkle Tree, a concept used in Blockchain systems.
This code generates 1 random string of characters and integers that is split into single-character strings. 
The strings are repeatedly hashed, concatendated, and rehashed until a single string remains. This procedure is recursive.
